Note: There has been much discussion recently regarding the LGPL and Java-based
projects. As a result, the following LGPL clarification applies (based upon a
similar clarification at http://www.hibernate.org):

JSAP is Free Software. The LGPL license is sufficiently flexible to allow the
use of JSAP in both open source and commercial projects. Using JSAP (by
importing JSAP's public interfaces in your Java code), and extending JSAP (by
subclassing) are considered by the authors of JSAP to be dynamic linking. Hence
our interpretation of the LGPL is that the use of the unmodified JSAP source or
binary, or the rebundling of unmodified JSAP classes into your program's .jar
file, does not affect the license of your application code.

If you modify JSAP and redistribute your modifications, the LGPL applies.
