 * Other code types will place objects corresponding to the
 * code type on the stack, after the code has been executed.
 * In case of mix code types, the object represented by the
 * first letter will be the first object to be pushed on the stack.
 * <p>
 * A piece of LR code will leave an update as the topmost entry
 * and a location right below it on the stack
